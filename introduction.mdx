# 🐣 Chat Messaging API

## 1. **Install open-chat-js SDK**

* In your project run `yarn add open-chat-js` or `npm install open-chat-js` with npm

## 2. Login

* Ok, so we're going to build a Messaging style chat. Let's get started by get the token for the sdk client to connect to server.
* Use this api \[DOMAIN]/login/:user\_id
* Use any user id for this demo and respose will return JWT token in this form

```json
{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoidmluaCIsImV4cCI6MTAwMDAwMDAwMDB9.t7-sbxaSfHSYZkSGXuVf2frPIQbAT01gzvFSBhOGl5U"
}
```

## 3. Setup a connection

* Ok, so we're going to build a Messaging style chat. Let's get started by connecting to Stream

```javascript
import {StreamChat} from 'open-chat-js';
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("dz5f4d5kzrue");
client.connectUser({
  id: "old-sunset-2",
  name: "old",
  image: "https://bit.ly/2u9Vc0r",
}, "Bearer [JWT]");
```

* StreamChat.getInstance function always returns the same Client instance to avoid issues raised by multiple Client and WS connections. After the first call, the client configuration will not change if the key or options parameters change

## 4.1 Create a Channel

* With the client set up, you'll want to create a channel with members:

```javascript
const channel = client.channel('team', 'P-yMXmwnBP', {
      name: "Private Chat About the Kingdom",
      image: "https://bit.ly/2F3KEoM",
      members: ["old-sunset-2]"
});
await channel.watch();
          
```

* On this example, the first argument is the channel type. Different channel types can have different features enabled and different permissions.
* The second argument is the ID of the conversation – it is optional, if you leave it out we will generate an ID based on the list of members.
* The third argument is an object with all the data for this channel. You can use this to store any custom metadata about this channel.

## **4.2 Connect to existed channel**

```javascript
const channel = client.channel("team", "HELLO");
await channel.watch()
```

* This example show case how to connect to existed channel using channel type & channel\_id
* Note: channel.watch() retrieves the current channel state (messages, members, read events etc.) and also ensures your current WebSocket connection listens to changes on this channel.

## 5. Send a Message

* Now that we have a channel up and runnning you can add a message to the channel

```javascript
const message = await channel.sendMessage({
  text: "Hello, world!",
});

return message;

```

* The first field of payload is message Id, must be unique
* The second field is the message text, can be any string

## 6. State & Listen to Events

* We can listen to channel event `message.new` when other user send to the channel

```javascript
channel.on("message.new", event => {
  logEvent(event);
});

await channel.sendMessage({
  text: "What is the medieval equivalent of tabs vs spaces?",
});
```

* The incoming event will be look something like this JSON

```json
{
  "type": "message.new",
  "cid": "messaging:the-small-council_ftfm_djiT9",
  "channel_id": "the-small-council_ftfm_djiT9",

}
```

## 7. Typing Event

* Call sendEvent typing, there are 2 typing event: "typing.start" and "typing.stop"

```javascript
channel.watch().then(() => {
   channel.sendEvent({
      type: "typing.start",
   }).then((res) => {
      console.log("-----------res tying-----------", res);
   });
});
```
